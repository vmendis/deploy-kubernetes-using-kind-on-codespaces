Notes on Deploying a kuberntes cluster using kind on Github Codespaces

Github Codespaces gives a cloud based development enviornment which can be hacked
to do other interesting small projects !

It is possible to use virtual machines (VM) from Azure or AWS for these type of hacks. But one must login to Azure or AWS and create the VMs. Here we get one-click enviornment for experementing. The beauty with codespace is, if you screw-up your VM, just delete and re-create a new one. takes only a few minutes.
